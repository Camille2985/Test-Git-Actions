# Test-Git-Actions

Basically just testing out how github actions work.

Idea:
- I want a github action that triggers a python script if a file is modified in a specific location on push
- I also only want it to happen when the commit has a tag of type "prod-blah blah"
- What file where modified also needs to be passed into the python file as args too
